## Contents

### 1) `Python-Sample.ipynb`
**Carbon Credit Retirements: Market Dynamics and Institutional Drivers**  
- **What it does:** Uses log-linear regression on 10,000+ project-level observations to identify determinants of carbon credit retirements.  
- **Key findings:** Compliance markets retire ~198% more credits than voluntary markets; volumes increased ~358% after the Paris Agreement; effects vary by project type, registry, and country, underscoring institutional drivers.  
- **Stack:** Python 3.10+, `pandas`, `numpy`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`.

### 2) `RMarkdown.pdf`
**Retail Analytics (coursework)**  
- **What it contains:** Clean, end-to-end write-up (R) covering descriptive stats, discrete choice / entry modeling, simple elasticity calculations, and a targeted promotion selection task (with mapping steps).  
- **Use case:** Read-only artifact that demonstrates reproducible analysis and interpretation in R.

### 3) `Stata-Sample.do`
**Equity Concentration, Agency Costs, and Firm Performance (China A-share 2014–2023)**  
- **Research question:** How does ownership concentration affect firm performance, and is the effect mediated by agency costs?  
- **Key findings (brief):**
  - Ownership concentration has a **significant positive** effect on performance.  
  - **Mediation:** Part of the effect operates **via reduced agency costs**.  
  - **Heterogeneity:** Stronger in **private** and **small** firms; attenuated in **SOEs**.  

### 4) `R-Sample.R` (Retail Location Strategy) 
**Retail Location Strategy Based on Consumer Segmentation and Market Gaps**  
- **What it does:** Uses Dominick’s Finer Foods database to model retail revenue drivers; builds a **Retail Suitability Index** via **Fuzzy AHP**; performs **K-means** clustering with **t-SNE** visualization; leverages **ArcGIS** for geospatial support on store placement/format strategy.  
- **Stack:** R 4.2+ (`tidyverse`, `cluster`, `Rtsne`, `FuzzyAHP`), ArcGIS/ArcGIS Pro for maps.

## Data & Reproducibility

- **Data paths:** Replace any placeholder file paths with your local paths (see comments at the top of the notebook / do-file / R scripts).  
- **Licensing:** Some datasets (e.g., market/registry or retail data) may be restricted. The code is written to run on similarly structured data.
